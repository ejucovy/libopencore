Features added
--------------

* The http proxy's load-balancer is now capable of sending robots 
  to a specific backend.

  To use it for a given backend, pass in a URL for ``robots_uri``
  and this URL will be chosen if the request's User-Agent string
  matches a set of known robots.

  To segregate robots from all other users, this URL could be
  omitted from the ``remote_uri`` parameter.

* The deliverance.xml rules now try to fetch `/openplans/xinha-config`
  if there is a `<div class="opencore_wysiwyg">` present in the page.
  This is used to apply a consistent Xinha editor to Wordpress pages.

Bugs Fixed
----------

* URLs to the root of a non-Zope opencore component must have a
  trailing slash; if they don't, a permanent redirect is issued
  to the correct URL.  (So /projects/foo/blog -> /projects/foo/blog/)
  The specific symptom I noticed was the link to "Write a new post"
  on the front page of a project's blog (when logged in as a project
  admin, when no posts have been made yet) was incorrectly missing the
  /blog/ component of the URL.  This behavior previously existed 
  somewhere in DeliveranceVHoster.

* Responses to Ajax requests (X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest) are
  not themed by Deliverance even if they have Content-Type: text/html.
  This fixes the behavior of TaskTracker's Ajax requests to post new
  comments on a task.

* The deliverance.xml rules no longer try to fetch `/openplans/oc-footer`
  or `/openplans/oc-header`; these have been unused for ages, so there's
  no need to make the extra subrequests to Zope.

Added a simple random-choice load balancer to the http proxy.

To use it for a given backend, pass in a space-separated list 
of URLs as ``remote_uri``instead of a single URL.  Assuming you
have identical applications listening at each URL, proxied
requests will be distributed across those URLs.

(The intended use is for multiple Zope instances talking to the
same ZEO server, though I guess it could also work for any of
the other applications if there was a reason.)

Bugs fixed
----------

* Work around a bug deeper in the stack which causes links in the
  response HTML like /foo/my.domain.com/bar/ to be rewritten as
  /foo/my.domain.com:80/bar/ if HTTP_HOST is my.domain.com:80

* Previously some proxied WordPress URLs were incorrect and resulting
  in 404s.  This is now fixed.


Features added
--------------

Added transcluder_middleware module and a ``libopencore#transcluder``
entry point for a paste.filter_factory.

If using transcluder middleware, Transcluder must be installed.

If using transcluder middleware, it should be the outermost wsgi filter
in your stack. This is because Transcluder sometimes makes internal WSGI
subrequests instead of HTTP calls, and calls its inner app.  So if you
have routing, security or anything else important outside Transcluder,
you may get strange results.

Added support for proxying to a Twirlip server. Twirlip must be
mounted on /notifications by a regular paste#urlmap (where / is then
mapped to the main libopencore composite app) and it must be wrapped
by transcluder middleware.

To use the Twirlip proxy, install libopencore's `twirlip` extra
requirements (listed in extras_require in setup.py).

To use the Twirlip proxy, use a libopencore#proxy app with the setting
`is_twirlip=true` and a setting `topp_secret_filename` that points to
the absolute path of the shared secret used for authentication.  Your
Twirlip proxy will be wrapped in Eyvind middleware which converts
REMOTE_USER into a special HTTP header signed with the shared secret,
which is then decoded by the Twirlip server.

Twirlip and Transcluder are currently used in an OpenCore stack to
provide subscription-based email notifications for wikipage edits and
changes to tasks. But don't try to use these unless you absolutely
need to -- I'm going to  replace Twirlip with something simpler before
long.

Added deliverance_middleware, wsgi, and http_proxy modules.

Added a sample paste.ini file showing how to combine these into a frontend app
that proxies to opencore, tasktracker and wordpress, and themes the responses
with deliverance when necessary.

Initial release.  Added auth module.
